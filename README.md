This is the code that was run during the demonstration of the project presentations. It uses the buttons on the MSP board in order to mimic the sensors as I was unable to get them to work with the MSP. On button press, the internal register called "rooom" increments. This register tracks the number of occupants detected by the system. This number is outputted to an LED array that displays the number of occupants, up to 3 but more could be added at a later date.
